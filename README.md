This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The program defines a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a string. The program then calls the function with an array of strings as an argument. This causes a type error because the function expects a string, not an array of strings. The solution is to iterate through the array and apply the function to each element.
